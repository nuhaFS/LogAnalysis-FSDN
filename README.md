pip install tabulate
```

**Python3:**

### Most Viewed Articles
This view will serve as a base query. It returns the articles according to most viewed ones.

> CREATE VIEW MostViewedArticles as SELECT articles.slug, COUNT(log.path) as NumberOfViews FROM log, articles WHERE SUBSTRING( log.path, 10) = articles.slug GROUP BY articles.slug ORDER BY NumberOfViews DESC;


### Detailed Status
This view generates the results for the logs status in details, showing the count of successful and failed  requests according to date.

> CREATE VIEW DetailedStatus as  SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN status='200 OK' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) as OkStatus, COUNT(CASE WHEN status= '404 NOT FOUND' THEN 1 ELSE NULL end) as NFStatus, date(time) as date FROM log GROUP BY date;


### Status Percentages
This view generates the Percentages for logs status per each day.

> CREATE VIEW PercentageOfStatus as SELECT (okstatus/ SUM( okstatus + nfstatus) * 100 ) as Ok, (nfstatus/ SUM( okstatus + nfstatus) * 100) as Error, date FROM DetailedStatus GROUP BY date, okstatus, nfstatus;
